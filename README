NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::AppCacheManifest - Offline web application manifest
    support for Mojolicious

SYNOPSIS
      # Mojolicious
      $self->plugin( "AppCacheManifest" );
      $self->plugin( "AppCacheManifest" => { extension => "manifest" } );
      $self->plugin( "AppCacheManifest" => { extension => [qw[ appcache manifest mf ]] } );
      $self->plugin( "AppCacheManifest" => { timeout => 60 * 5 } );
  
      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin "AppCacheManifest";
      plugin "AppCacheManifest" => { extension => "manifest" };
      plugin "AppCacheManifest" => { extension => [qw[ appcache manifest mf ]] };
      plugin "AppCacheManifest" => { timeout => 60 * 5 };

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin manages manifest delivery for Offline Web applications
    <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html>.
    It read manifests, checks modification of contained files that exist
    in static directories, and returns a clean manifest with only one
    comment containing a timestamp to allow for cache invalidation on
    changes.

OPTIONS
  extension
      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin "AppCacheManifest" => { extension => "manifest" };
      plugin "AppCacheManifest" => { extension => [qw[ appcache manifest mf ]] };

    Manifest file extension, allows array references to pass multiple
    extensions and defaults to "appcache".

  timeout
      # Mojolicious::Lite
      plugin "AppCacheManifest" => { timeout => 60 * 5 };

    Cache timeout after which all files in the cache section of manifests
    get checked again, defaults to 0 seconds (disabled).

    Note: Manifests are always tested and trigger a full check when they
    change.

METHODS
  timeout
    Accessor for "timeout", see above.

SEE ALSO
    *       Specification for Offline Web applications
            <http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/offline.html>.

    *       HTML5::Manifest has a different approach by generating the
            manifest programmatically.
